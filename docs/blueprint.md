## Core Features:

- Interactive Dashboard: Dashboard interface mimicking a modern OS, featuring draggable/floating windows for 'About Me', 'Skills & Stack', 'Projects', and 'Contact'.
- API Documentation UI: API Explorer tab displaying mock endpoints (GET /about, GET /skills, GET /projects, POST /contact) with sample requests/responses from Firestore.
- Hidden Terminal: Hidden terminal window (Ctrl + ~) that supports commands like 'list projects', 'whoami', and 'connect', offering developer jokes.
- Contact Form: Firebase contact form to enable email communication.
- AI Project Prompter: AI-powered tool that provides smart suggestions on project tags that would improve discoverability, as well as generate improved titles and project descriptions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to represent trust, intelligence, and stability.
- Background color: Dark navy (#1A237E), desaturated, to maintain a dark color scheme for contrast and readability.
- Accent color: Indigo (#5C6BC0), slightly different in brightness and saturation than the primary blue.
- Clean, modern sans-serif font for both headings and body text to ensure readability across devices.
- Use minimalistic line icons for skills and technologies.
- Dashboard-inspired layout with draggable windows, soft shadows, and rounded corners.
- Subtle animations for window opening/closing and theme toggle, enhancing user experience without being distracting.
